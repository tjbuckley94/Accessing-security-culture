Step 1: Measure and Set Goals

Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

Allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices can potentially create a multitude of problems for a company.For example: malware, data theft, and rogue devices are very typical threats when employees use their own devices. Malware can be installed on an employee’s personal device without them realizing it. They could open a link or download an unsafe app that has malware installed in the background to search through the device's data. If the device has any company information on it, that could lead to destruction. Going from a home wifi network to a company wifi network could spread malware further. Data theft can also happen in this way. When a person logs onto their home wifi or an unsecure “cafe wifi” which is common among work-from-home employees, data can be breached and stolen without the user knowing. Many people would assume that their home wifi or a public network would not pose problems or threats when in fact, most home and public networks do not have firewalls or security to protect a user's data. Rogue devices also pose a threat to company information. An apple user may have a “jailbroken” iPhone which allows the iPhone user to access unrestricted applications or phone customizations that are not “pre-approved” by Apple. Apple products typically have built in antivirus software but once a phone or other device is compromised by the “jailbreak” the antivirus software is useless.


Based on the previous scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? (For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources.)

Some employees may not be as “tech-savvy” as others, so there needs to be consistent and thorough policies and training in place for employees to learn the risks of harmful threats to company data. Training can range from monthly or quarterly (depending on the level of security the company would like to enforce) and informational videos with quizzes to mock phishing emails to ensure that employees are on guard and prepared for these real-world situations. I would also suggest incentives to employees that continually pass the mock phishing email tests by rewarding those with a half work day! The employees could choose which day they would like to receive this “free” half-day as long as it was approved by a supervisor. Let’s be honest, most people, if given a choice, would choose not to work 8 hours a day, so if given the chance to have a half-day with no consequences people will be attentive and more likely to remember threat assessment techniques. This could also lead to higher retention rates with employees which would increase the level of satisfaction at a company. This could save a company thousands of dollars by not having to rehire and retrain employees, fix common mistakes with data breaches and malware, as well as not having to give extended and costly training to those who do not understand or do not take cybersecurity threats seriously. 


What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior? (For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders.)

As stated above, I would conduct monthly training videos/PowerPoints to inform employees of potential risks they could face. Supplemental to those training efforts I would implement quarterly mock phishing emails or something similar (such as a flash drive left on desk to lure someone to plug it into their computer) that would put their training to the test. Those who pass the mock cybersecurity threats would be rewarded. Those who do not retain the information and fall for the scheme would be required to review the PowerPoints previously received. 


What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? (For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.)

Ideally, a company would aim for 0% of their employees to not open or download suspicious email attachments or other potential threats. But, sometimes there is human error with these things. Someone could be having a bad day and going through the motions, not fully paying attention, or accidentally opening something they shouldn’t have. Which is understandable, unless it is always the same employee engaging in this behavior then that could be something else entirely. As a human, accidents happen so I think, depending on the size of a company, because that could skew numbers; a 3% or less for smaller companies and a 5% or less for larger companies would be a goal to strive for. 



Step 2: Involve the Right People
 
List at least five employees or departments that should be involved. For each person or department, describe in 2–3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.

The company should include the CEO, CFO, COO, CISO, and CIO, in their plans to secure their data and information. The CEO is the head honcho of any company. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) acts as the “President” of the company who can mandate or eliminate policies and procedures at the highest level. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would be vital to involve in company plans because they control all of the finances for the company. They know if the company is in the positive or the negative at any given time and what can be spent. The Chief Operating Office (COO) would be another important figure in this group as they ensure the business is running efficiently in all capacities. They can be seen as a “Vice President” to the CEO. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) work hand-in-hand in these operations as they both relate to the company's security and technical side of operations. They would be enforcing and assessing any risks that could interrupt the company’s day to day and future operations.



Step 3: Training Plan

How frequently will you run training? What format will it take (e.g., in-person, online, a combination of both)?

In my opinion, online training would be the best format to educate employees. When given a timeframe to complete training, they will be more receptive and willing to participate. If given the ultimatum to attend in-person training, some people may not be as receptive or attentive to the information due to zoning out, having a bad day, thinking about other tasks they need to complete etc. I think a monthly online training would be ideal, even if it is short, to retain and continually remind people of cybersecurity threats. In addition to the online training there should be quarterly “live” training, via a mock phishing email or another creative alternative, to test the online training retention. This could show the effectiveness of the online training as well as rule out those who are skipping through PowerPoint slides or videos and not taking the training seriously.


What topics will you cover in your training, and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

Suspicious attachments/links, logging into company databases or emails on unrestricted wifi networks, plugging in foreign devices into computers, downloading extensions or unauthorized applications onto devices would all be topics I would cover in my training. I would also educate the employees on the power of using strong and unique passwords on all of their work AND personal sites/applications. This is a huge deterrent to threat actors and a foundational first step to protecting a company and individuals information.


After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 

I would measure the effectiveness of my training with the mock phishing emails or other mock trials that I have put in place. As stated before, the flash drive left on a person’s desk could pose as a potential “live” training exercise. The person may pick up the flash drive and plug it in to their company computer with no ill will, they could just be trying to figure out who it belonged to, and the flash drive would show a message that said, “Oops, you’ve plugged in a foreign device that could potentially be harmful, please return to [insert name]”. This would be a direct way to find out who was not paying attention to previous training exercises. The mock phishing emails could also be loaded with an automated message that is sent to the IT/Cybersecurity department with a list of employee names that click on the phishing email. 



Bonus: Other Solutions

List at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:
What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical? 
What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?
What is one advantage of each solution? 
What is one disadvantage of each solution?

Another potential threat to the cybersecurity of a company could be physical. This could be as simple as employees tailgating into the entrance of the building. A company could require key card access to the front door of the building, if it is not open to the public, and the employees do not take it seriously and let in anyone that is following behind them into the building. This could especially happen with large companies where people may not know everybody who works within the same building as them. A solution to  this risk would be placing security guards at the entrance of the building. These security guards would also ensure that everyone is scanning their keycards for ONLY themselves. If a person has their hands full, be it carrying in a box of personal items, then the person would have to ask the security guard for help entering the building instead of relying on a coworker to hold the door open for them and not scanning their keycard. An advantage to this preventive and deterrent method would be that any person without a keycard on their person would not be allowed into the building. That is a security risk that can be easily avoided. A disadvantage to this would be that security guards cost money. Most companies operate from 8am to 5pm, therefore multiple “shifts” of security guards would need to be employed to cover breaks of the other security officers and to ensure there is no fatigue to allow human error within the enforcement of this policy. 


Administrative risks, such as insider trading of information or disgruntled employees could also pose a risk to a company's cybersecurity. To ensure this does not happen there needs to be rules and regulations in place in order for these activities to be avoided. A company should have a system of “checks and balances” within itself so that no one person has sole power over any given department. This helps give employees a feeling of the “eagle eye” and peer pressure that someone could always be watching what they are doing. If a person is fired or upset that someone received a promotion over them, the company should have security protocols in place so that information cannot be accessed without permissions or encrypted data in the case of an “insider leak” of information. This is also a preventive and deterrent method. An advantage to this methodology would be that people typically respond to the feeling of peer pressure. If a person fears that someone is always watching them, then they will act in more of a well-mannered way. The disadvantage to this would be that some people can be vindictive regardless of the consequences. If a disgruntled employee, somehow, flew under the radar and leaked information to an outside source, that could end very badly for the company. These techniques could also cost a company a decent amount of money as well. There would need to be policies, software, firewalls, and cybersecurity employees all working together to protect the company.
